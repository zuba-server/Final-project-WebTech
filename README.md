I tried  to upload my project on github but it was showing me that the file is too large to upload, so I ziped the project.

This online banking system is a comprehensive platform designed to revolutionize financial interactions. 
The project is bifurcated into two vital components:
backend  
frontend

The database backbone is supported by Postgres, guaranteeing efficient data storage and retrieval.
To validate and refine the system, Postman played a crucial role in the testing phase.
Before launching the backend, it is imperative to create a database named 'banking' to support the seamless flow of financial transactions and interactions.
